### Design and implement a tool that allows users to
○ Post programming questions
○ Provide answers/responses

### Your tool must allow users to
○ create channels
○ view all channel
○ select a channel and to post messages in that channel
○ post replies to existing messages

The user interface must be implemented in Reactjs and all text data must be stored in a
mysql and/or CouchDB database.

# Part 1 - Basic System (30%)
## Design and implement the database tables
○ Expose the mysql and/or CouchDB databases using separate nodejs servers

## Design and implement the user interface using Reactjs
Your application should use react-dom-router and provide at least
■ Landing page that offers a brief description/intro into your system
■ Page that allows users to see/create/select channel and see/create new messages or
replies
■ Enable users to post screenshots as part of a question or reply

# Part 2 - Adding User Accounts (20%)
Extend part 1 to enable users of your system to have accounts and enforce that only registered users can use
your system.

An account should consist of at least:
○ ID
○ Password
○ Name that is displayed in messages/replies/channels
You can add additional elements e.g. avatar/image for the user
● Make sure that users can create an account & that users must always first sign in before using your system
● Create one special account for a system administrator (can be hardcoded) that has the power to remove users,
channels, posts and replies.

# Part 3 - Nested Replies & Ratings (10%)
## ● Expand/change your database and your Reactjs app to
○ Allow your users to reply to replies
○ Visualize the nested replies
## ● Allow users to approve or disapprove a post or reply
○ Use a thumbs-up/down with counter

# Part 4 - Search Feature (10%)
## ● Allow your users to search the data in your system to answer questions like
○ content that contain specific strings e.g. list all content that contains the string “arrow function”.
○ content created by a specific user
○ User with the most/least posts
○ User with the highest/lowest ranking of messages/replies
○ ...

# Part 5 - Useful Extra Features (10 %)
## ● Add features you consider useful in the context of dealing with programming issues
○ E.g.
■ classifications of users e.g. beginner .. expert
■ Hosting system in the cloud
■ Design user interface that supports mobile clients
■ ...
○

# What to submit
● docker-compose.yml file (and if needed additional dockerfile(s))
● All .js, .css files you created or modified e.g. App.js
● package.json files
● Design-Report: 1-page report describing your architecture/design decisions of
your database and the react application
● Test-Report: 1-page test report demonstrating how you tested your system
● A link to a 10 minute video of you presenting your system and demonstrating
the features of your system (worth 10% of grade)

# Evaluation
● What parts have been implemented (fully/partially/incomplete)?
● Do they work?
● Part 1 = 30%
● Part 2 = 20%
● Part 3 = 10%
● Part 4 = 10%
● Part 5 = 10%
● Design report = 5%
● Test report = 5%
